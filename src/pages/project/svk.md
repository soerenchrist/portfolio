To simplify the management of members as well as the accounting for my local sports club I built a web application. It includes a user and role system which allows all members of the *management* to access the data.
In certain events, like anniversaries or birthdays of members, the system automatically sends notification mails. The treasurer can upload his receipts including an attachment.
All common files like application forms, templates or logos can be uploaded to a document area.

Some of the technologies I used:
- Dotnet 6
- Blazor WebAssembly
- [MatBlazor](https://www.matblazor.com/)
- EntityFramework
- ASP.NET Core WebAPI
- MySQL
