Tourgether is a social network for hiking tours. You can upload your tours with your GPS tracks, view nice stats and charts and share them with your friends or the community. The application comes with more than 20.000 different peaks, which you can add to your tour, so you can keep track of all the mountains you climbed.
The app is publicly available at [tourgether.eu](https://tourgether.eu). 

Also the code is open source on [Github](https://github.com/soerenchrist/tourgether).
