BLE Server is an application to simulate Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. It will help you to develop your Software without having your real BLE device at hand. Just configure your device to behave just like your sensor or IOT device and you are good to go!

Features are:

- Create your own devices, services and characteristic
- Choose from different templates, like speed, cadence or location sensors
- Configure your characteristics for reading, writing or notifications
- Get notified, when some value gets written to the device
- Change the value of the characteristic

It is currently available for windows. You can download it from the [store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NPBRWNX7DHV).

Some of the technologies I used:
- Dotnet 6
- MAUI
