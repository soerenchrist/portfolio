*Hanoi - Speed Run* is a simple game I created for Android. It is an implementation of the well-known game Hanoi. 
The game is developed using Xamarin Forms and it's main point is to finish the game as fast as possible with the least amount of moves.
You can download the game from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.soerenchrist.hanoi&gl=DE)

Some of the technologies I used:
- C#
- Xamarin Forms
- [SkiaSharp](https://trpc.io)
- SQLite
- [ReactiveUI](https://www.reactiveui.net/)
