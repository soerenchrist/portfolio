GeographyHero is a collection of different geography based games. Those include:
*Secret Country*: Find the secret country as fast as you can by following the distance hints.
*Shape Guesser*: Try to guess the correct country only by its shape.
*Country Feud*: Decide which of two countries win in a give category (size, population, density...)
*Flag Guesser*: How many flags can you guess correctly in one minute?
The app is publicly available at [geohero.soerenchrist.de](https://geoher.soerenchrist.de). 

Some of the technologies I used:
- Dotnet 6
- Blazor WebAssembly
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com)
- [MatBlazor](https://www.matblazor.com/)
- EntityFramework
- ASP.NET Core WebAPI
